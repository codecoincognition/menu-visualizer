Design Prompt: Redesign of the "Menu Visualizer" Landing Page
Objective:
To evolve the current "Menu Visualizer" screen into a more intuitive, interactive, and streamlined user experience. The new design should reduce cognitive load, guide the user directly to the core action, and create a sense of anticipation for the AI-generated results.

Guiding Principles:

Clarity over Clutter: Every element should have a clear purpose. Remove redundancy.

Guided Action: The design should naturally lead the user's eye from the value proposition to the primary action.

Interactive Engagement: Move from a static display to an interactive canvas that encourages user input.

Manage Expectations: Hint at the outcome to make the tool's function more tangible from the start.

Specific Design Requirements:
1. Layout and Structure: Two-Column Experience

Transition from the current single-column layout to a two-column layout.

Left Column: This will be the dedicated "Input & Control" panel. It will house the text area and the primary action button.

Right Column: This will be the "Output & Visualization" panel. It is where the generated food images will appear.

In the initial "empty state," the right column should display a subtle placeholder. This could be a set of empty, ghosted image cards or a simple illustration with a message like "Your beautiful food images will appear here."

2. Header and Typography:

Eliminate Redundancy: Remove the large, centered "Menu Visualizer" H1 heading. The existing title in the top navigation bar is sufficient.

Elevate the Sub-headline: Make the sub-headline ("Transform your menu text into beautiful food images with AI") more prominent. This should be the primary piece of text the user reads after the brand logo.

3. The Unified Input Area (Left Column):

Combine Inputs: Replace the separate text area and "Upload Menu" button with a single, large, unified input component.

Functionality: This component should serve as both:

A multi-line text area for pasting or typing.

A drag-and-drop zone for text files.

Instructional Text: The placeholder text inside should be clear and encouraging. Example: Paste your menu items here, one per line...

Integrated Upload: Within this component, include a subtle text link for file uploads. For instance: ...or **browse for a file**. This removes the need for a secondary upload button.

4. Interactive "Try a Sample" Feature:

Remove the Static Box: Eliminate the separate "Sample Menu" informational box.

Create an Actionable Link: Directly underneath the input area, add a clickable link or a small, secondary button with the text: Try a Sample Menu.

Interaction: When a user clicks this link, the input area should be instantly populated with the sample menu items (Grilled Salmon, Caesar Salad, etc.), and the main CTA button should become active.

5. The Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) Button:

Single, Clear Button: There should be only one primary CTA button, located below the input area in the left column.

Labeling: Use an action-oriented label like "Visualize Menu" or "Generate Images". Consider including a small, relevant icon (like a âœ¨ sparkle or a ðŸª„ magic wand) to reinforce the AI aspect.

Dynamic State: The button's state is critical:

Disabled (Default): The button is visually disabled (e.g., grayed out, low opacity) when the input area is empty.

Enabled (Active): The button instantly becomes active and fully colored the moment the input area receives text (from typing, pasting, file upload, or using the sample).
